# ðŸ“¶ Network Simulation Lab with Cisco Packet Tracer

## ðŸ“œ Background / Scenario
Your aunt owns a small insurance agency. She recently purchased a Cisco router and switch. She has two wired PCs that need to be connect to the network. She is proud of your progress in your networking course and asked you if you would like to demonstrate your skills. Your job is to connect the devices, implement a basic configuration, and verify connectivity. After network connectivity has been verified, you will use IOS commands to retrieve information from the devices to answer questions about your network equipment. You will also configure the router for secure remote access.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic network simulation using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It includes:
- **1 Router**
- **2 Switches**
- **4 PCs (End devices)**
- Basic configurations such as IP addressing, VLAN setup, and connectivity testing.
