# ðŸ“¶ Network Simulation Lab with Cisco Packet Tracer

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic network simulation using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It includes:
- **1 Router**
- **2 Switches**
- **4 PCs (End devices)**
- Basic configurations such as IP addressing, VLAN setup, and connectivity testing.

## ðŸ’» Network Topology
  [PC1] ---- [Switch1] ---- [Router] ---- [Switch2] ---- [PC2]
  [PC3] ----/                     \\---- [PC4]
